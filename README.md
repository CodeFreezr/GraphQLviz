# GraphQLviz [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Macroz/GraphQLviz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Macroz/GraphQLViz)

GraphQLviz marries GraphQL (schemas) with Graphviz.

It's a tool to show you what your schema really looks like. At the moment, it's mostly useful as a complement to [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), like printing a huge poster size version to facilitate team discussions.

## Usage

You can use GraphQLviz from command-line if you have [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) and [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org) like this.

```
lein run examples/digitransit.json digitransit
```

Also there is a prepackaged jar in [Clojars](https://clojars.org/macroz/graphqlviz).

There is also a convenient uberjar available to download from the releases.

You can use it like a regular Java app like this.

```
java -jar graphqlviz.jar examples/digitransit.json digitransit
```

[Example schema](examples/digitransit.json?raw=true) (from [Digitransit](http://digitransit.fi))

![Example graph](https://rawgit.com/Macroz/GraphQLviz/master/examples/digitransit.svg)

To run against a live GraphQL server, you can use the introspection query like this.

```
java -jar graphqlviz.jar http://digitransit.fi/otp/routers/finland/index/graphql digitransit
```

Since 0.4.0, you can pass options for authenticating with the server for the introspection query (`-a` or `--auth`).

The supported authentication types are `basic`, `digest` (with user and password) as well as `oauth2` (with oauth token) See also `-h` for help.

```
java -jar graphqlviz.jar http://secret.example.com/graphql secret-schema-name -abasic -utester -ppassword
```

Or with password prompt `-pp` or `--password-prompt`.

```
java -jar graphqlviz.jar http://secret.example.com/graphql secret-schema-name -abasic -utester --password-prompt
```

Futhermore if you want to use the code from Clojure, add to your project.clj:

## Backlog

- Use dynamic graph features as in [archi](https://github.com/Macroz/archi)
- Develop a complete JavaScript solution of the same idea
